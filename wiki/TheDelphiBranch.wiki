#summary MiniLaunchBar was initially developed under Delphi and that version is still available in the "branches" folder of the SVN. Although it was only a Beta version, it is very stable and can be used without any risk of having it crash your computer.

Below are some information on how to build the project. You can also get the latest Delphi build in the Downloads section.

= Details =

This project is developed and built using Turbo Delphi Explorer, available for free at http://www.turboexplorer.com/delphi

Additionally, MiniLaunchBar requires the Microsoft XML 5 OLE object, which should be installed on most systems. This depency might be removed in a futur version in favor of an open source library such as OpenXML.
