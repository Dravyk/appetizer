#summary Some information about the Delphi branch.

= Introduction =

MiniLaunchBar was initially developed under Delphi and that version is still available in the "branches" folder of the SVN. Although it was only a Beta version, it is very stable and can be used without any risks.

= Details =

This Delphi branch is developed and built using Turbo Delphi Explorer, available for free at http://www.turboexplorer.com/delphi

Additionally, MiniLaunchBar requires the Microsoft XML 5 OLE object, which should be installed on most systems. This depency might be removed in a futur version in favor of an open source library such as OpenXML.
