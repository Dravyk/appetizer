#summary Some information on how to build this project

== Details ==

This project is developed and built using [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/ Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition] and [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] (2.8.9 Unicode). The [http://www.boost.org/ Boost C++ libraries] must also be installed on your system.

== Required environment variables ==

In order to build the project, you must set two environment variables:

 * *WXWIN* that points to your wxWidgets folder (eg C:\wxWidgets-2.8.9)

 * *BOOST_ROOT* that points to your Boost folder (eg c:\boost_1_36_0)

See [http://priyank.co.in/readarticle.php?article_id=1 here] for some information on how to do that.

== Supported OS ==

Currently, wxMiniLaunchBar can only be built under Windows (tested under XP only).
