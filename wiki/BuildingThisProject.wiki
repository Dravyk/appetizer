#summary Some information on how to build this project

= Details =

This project is developed and built using Turbo Delphi Explorer, available for free at http://www.turboexplorer.com/delphi

Additionally, MiniLaunchBar requires the Microsoft XML 5 OLE object, which should be installed on most systems. This depency might be removed in a futur version in favor of an open source library such as OpenXML.
