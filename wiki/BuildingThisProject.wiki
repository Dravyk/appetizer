#summary Some information on how to build this project

= Details =

This project is developed and built using [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/ Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition] and [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] (2.8.9, Unicode Build).

In order to build the project, you must set a WXWIN environment variable and make it point to your wxWidgets folder as shown [http://priyank.co.in/readarticle.php?article_id=1 here]. Also make sure that you have [http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Microsoft_Visual_CPP_Guide built] the wxWidgets Unicode libraries.

Currently wxMiniLaunchBar can only build under Windows (tested under Vista).
